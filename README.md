# Django Local Library
**Interactive Website for Local Library Built with Django**

## Overview

This web application is designed to serve as an online catalog for a small local library, allowing users to browse the available books and manage their personal accounts.

The key features implemented so far include:

* Models for books, copies of books, genres, languages, and authors are in place.
* Users can view lists and detailed information about books and authors.
* Admin users can create and manage these models. The admin interface has been optimized, with basic registration in admin.py, though currently commented out.
* Librarians can renew reserved books.
